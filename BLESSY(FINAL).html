<h1><font color="blue"><b><i>To my loving parents</b></i>,</h1>
<P>   To my <b>marvelous</b> and <b>loving</b> parents, I was too blessed for being your daughter because all my life you’ve never let me feel
   being <del>unloved</del>. Though sometimes your being too strict and over protective on me but I understand that this is for my own good and
   I admit that often I get angry whenever you correct and scolded me.<br>
<br>

      To my beloved “nanay”, thank you so much, no words can express on how much I truly love you and you didn’t rule only as a good mother to
   me but rather a best friend also, thank you for listening to my random “<em>chika</em>” and especially for comforting me whenever i’m sad
   and hopeless. Indeed that "<ins>no one can replace the love of your mother</ins>" because you prove that to me, not just in a single situation
   but always. Thank you for serves as a good listener and secret keeper for me because I really feel being listened, and after saying 
   to you all my problems I feel at ease and I was touched also whenever I remembered those days that you never abandoned me in times 
   that I need someone to be my crying shoulder and I was grateful on how you supported me in every extracurricular I join. To my tatay, all in
   one in life. Thank you for giving the life that we have right now, you never failed us and I may not notice all 
   your sacrifices for us but I know that you did a great service on us. I value all your hardwork just to sustain us everyday, I
   understand that you’re not good at expressing your love but I know how much you love us. Thank you so much tay, and I truly love you.<br>
<br>

      <i><b>Nay and tay I truly cherish all your efforts, all your sacrifices really matters to me and that will serve as my motivation to keep
   going in times that I feel like giving up, you and tatay’s passion for teaching and understanding us was really amazing. Thank you
   for teaching me on how to stand on my own feet and never depend on someone, you have thought me so well in terms in aspect of
   life and also I like it on how you raised us with a fear on Lord. I hope and pray to God that someday I will achieve my dreams so
   that I can paid all your sacrifices for us. I hope that I can give you the life that you’ve been wanting for.</i></b> <strong>ILOVEYOUU NANAY AND TATAY!!</strong><br>
